## Welcome to our guidelines!

Before contributing to any project, please read the guidelines below carefully to understand how we work, our requirements, and the best practices we expect.

### How we work

We value quality, consistency, and clarity in all our translations and translation-related projects. To ensure this, we follow a set of internal rules and policies:

* **Source language:** We only translate content that is originally in English (or in the intended language the final player understands). This ensures content fidelity and immersion.
* **Central management:** All translations and final decisions are managed by the core Source BR team. Contributors may suggest changes, corrections, and submit their translations to us, but the final validation is always done by us.
* **Support:** We are willing to help contributors translate our projects into their language by creating documentation and communicating directly through Discord.
* **Credits:** Every contribution will be properly acknowledged. Contributors involved in projects will receive appropriate credit in the final files/documentation.

### Good conduct

* **Respect above all:** Respect all team members and fellow contributors.
* **Be clear and direct:** When suggesting changes or corrections, explain your reasoning and provide examples whenever possible.
* **Follow the project’s style:** Each project may have its own specifics (e.g., formatting, tone of language). Make sure to follow the established standards.
* **Review before submitting:** Simple mistakes can be avoided with a quick review. We appreciate your care!
* **Credits:** When using, distributing, or modifying any of our projects, please give proper credit.
